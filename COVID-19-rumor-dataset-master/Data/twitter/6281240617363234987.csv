6281240617363234987,Fri Mar 27 2020,@robbystarbuck @TrumpWarRoom @MSNBC @SRuhle @HansNichols Please get the Fox and conservative outlets to stop acting like CNN &amp; MSNBC.  The states including TX have banned the OLU of chloroquine &amp; hydroxychloroquine. In OUTPATIENT settings. A chart order is fine. In 2001 cipro was impossible to get because of the anthrax scare.,Fri Mar 27 02:32:31 +0000 2020,0,0,0,52:42.9,support
