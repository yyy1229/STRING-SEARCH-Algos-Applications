And it's highly contagious. But the weird thing is the variation. In Rome a couple from China got it, they'd toured Italy and then ended up on ventilators...",Mon Feb 24 19:28:52 +0000 2020,0,1,1,47:49.3,support

They got it and pneumonia and are in serious condition. It's strange, seems like it effects some people more than others, sometimes hits young, healthy people hard",Mon Feb 24 18:24:19 +0000 2020,0,0,0,47:49.3,support
