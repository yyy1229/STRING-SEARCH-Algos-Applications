7688735674171962163,Sun Feb 09 2020,@florian_krammer Are vaccines the answer? Broadly acting host targeted antiviral drugs? Broad spectrum antibodies? Better public health and surveillance of things we know so you know when new things arise? All good things that together make us resilient to current and future incoming pathogens.,Mon Feb 10 02:13:59 +0000 2020,0,8,8,37:13.5,query
7688735674171962163,Sun Feb 09 2020,@florian_krammer @mlipsitch Yup! This link shows what the world spent on insurance premiums in 2018. The amounts you are proposing would be a rounding error in that context! https://t.co/VT72KtngUa,Mon Feb 10 01:49:13 +0000 2020,0,0,0,37:13.5,support

7688735674171962163,Sun Feb 09 2020,@florian_krammer No. Vaccines for viruses that might harm us? As a country and as a world we cant even take appropriate action against global warming which is guaranteed to harm us,Sun Feb 09 23:11:11 +0000 2020,0,0,0,37:13.5,query
7688735674171962163,Sun Feb 09 2020,@florian_krammer @mlipsitch The problem is different parts of gov't feel the costs/savings and they don't trade with each other. Econ losses don't come out of public health budgets. Econ savings don't go into public health funding. &lt;sigh&gt;,Sun Feb 09 23:53:37 +0000 2020,0,1,1,37:13.5,comment

7688735674171962163,Sun Feb 09 2020,@florian_krammer We can certainly hope so. The current emphasis on quick fixing disease control is certainly not going to help. There is a need for sustained investment into surveillance into emerging infectious diseases; and companies with the most to lose should think about it too.,Tue Feb 11 09:05:51 +0000 2020,0,0,0,37:16.1,support
