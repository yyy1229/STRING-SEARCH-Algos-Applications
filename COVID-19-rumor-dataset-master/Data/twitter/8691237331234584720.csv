At a skim read its takeaway message seems to be roughly ""scientists say we don't know be cautious, but mostly it's rumour."" This is at least how ppl are treating it in my Facebook.Um, have you seen this?",Thu Mar 19 14:29:28 +0000 2020,0,0,0,15:00.6,query

8691237331234584720,Thu Mar 19 2020,@LucyWhelan The message remains - there is no strong evidence around covid and ibuprofen but the recommendation is to stick to paracetamol unless you have a reason not to,Thu Mar 19 14:44:45 +0000 2020,0,2,2,15:00.6,deny
