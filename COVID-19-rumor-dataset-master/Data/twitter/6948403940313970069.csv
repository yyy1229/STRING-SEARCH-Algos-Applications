6948403940313970069,Tue Apr 07 2020,@dalexan909 @ChristinePolon1 Exactly. The timing of the rollout and the CV hotspots are 5g areas. Wuhan is covered in 5g. They had massive protests last summer. A little payback maybe?,Tue Apr 07 06:19:11 +0000 2020,0,2,2,24:33.4,support

6948403940313970069,Tue Apr 07 2020,I think I'm onto something big here. Does hydrochloroquine stop the harmful effects of 5G-the actual cause for CoronaVirus? It stops the harmful effects of chemo/radiation in most cases. I really think this is why the miraculous turnaround in most cases.https://t.co/OugtupyipS,Tue Apr 07 02:03:03 +0000 2020,2227,3469,3469,24:33.4,support
