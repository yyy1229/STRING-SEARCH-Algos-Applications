4922292257272248253,Tue Mar 17 2020,@doubleSdev We will still continue processing returns by mail.Even though we have 45 days in the policy our direction to stores is to always exceed the customer‚Äôs expectation. Once we reopen we will send communication to the stores to extend the return policy and take care of the customer.,Tue Mar 17 13:44:59 +0000 2020,0,1,1,43:34.1,comment
