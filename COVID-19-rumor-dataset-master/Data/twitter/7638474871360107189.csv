7638474871360107189,Thu Jan 30 2020,"@NPR It's serious.  The real fatality rate is closer to 10% (see Lancet  link below), not 2% as widely reported.  There is a counting lag in the number of cases vs. deaths.  The death rate should based on the number of cases as counted 3-7 days before. https://t.co/WDBFlCnYuS",Thu Jan 30 18:02:48 +0000 2020,0,1,1,02:40.5,comment
7638474871360107189,Thu Jan 30 2020,Actual CFR and estimated real fatality rate depends of how many days averagely it takes for a person to die. Probably in reality it 4-5 days (just an estimation based on some early reports I have seen) which means about 15% fatality rate.#coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak https://t.co/HfbRD4zoVJ,Mon Jan 27 14:19:59 +0000 2020,8,15,15,02:40.5,comment
