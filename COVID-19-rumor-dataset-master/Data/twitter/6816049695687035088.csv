6816049695687035088,Mon Mar 02 2020,@ffs_taylor @4everNeverTrump That's the exact point. We don't know the death rate because we don't know have many have been tested vs dying. Maybe that's why their hiding the tested number. Maybe the rate has skyrocketed because the virus has mutated... we just don't know.,Mon Mar 02 22:57:11 +0000 2020,0,5,5,50:27.0,comment
