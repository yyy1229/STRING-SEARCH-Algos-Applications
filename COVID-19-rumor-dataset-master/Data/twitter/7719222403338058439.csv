7719222403338058439,Sun Mar 01 2020,@UnbreakableHate @CDCgov @US_FDA @Surgeon_General Government agencies do not actually do mush except shuffle papers. Government cannot solve a problem because they are the root of the problem. https://t.co/nSLy3x8pXd,Sun Mar 01 18:04:10 +0000 2020,3,5,5,37:23.7,comment
7719222403338058439,Sun Mar 01 2020,@UnbreakableHate @CDCgov @US_FDA @Surgeon_General I could definitely see people not wanting to go to the doctors if they thought they had the coronavirus.Who the fuck would wanted to be quarantined with an alternate version of the flu. People have lives and animals.Pets can't take care of themselves.,Mon Mar 02 06:28:30 +0000 2020,0,3,3,37:23.8,comment
7719222403338058439,Sun Mar 01 2020,"@AlexStaines1 @UnbreakableHate @CDCgov @US_FDA @Surgeon_General Mostly agreed. But we should also ask how many vapers are catching COVID-19. I suspect the number is very low. PG vapor is a powerful protection against airborne contagions, including the flu. It's possible that @VapingSavesLives in more ways than we thought.",Mon Mar 02 05:30:04 +0000 2020,2,3,3,37:23.8,support

After going though the Vaping ""Epidemic"" which was fake. Now we are faced with a possible real Epidemic with our U.S. General Selfie in charge @JeromeAdamsMD responsible for keeping us informed and safe. Uhmm. No thanks.",Sun Mar 01 19:42:14 +0000 2020,3,9,9,37:23.8,deny

7719222403338058439,Sun Mar 01 2020,"@UnbreakableHate @CDCgov @US_FDA @Surgeon_General They're obviously imbeciles. They have misinformed everybody about vaping, I wouldn't trust them to contain the flu-like virus.I wouldn't doubt if somebody was coughing they would lock them up in quarantine while their pets die at home, such a sad country we live in.",Mon Mar 02 06:25:52 +0000 2020,0,3,3,37:23.8,deny
