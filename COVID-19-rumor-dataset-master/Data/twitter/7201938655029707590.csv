The viral particles are too small and the filtration ability of surgical masks is insufficient. Even N-95 masks fail to protect you.1/2",Sat Feb 29 21:12:55 +0000 2020,1904,3589,3589,59:07.3,deny

Properly fitted and worn N95 masks do reduce droplet transmission. They may not prevent aerosol transmission, but this has not as been proven. If N95 masks are not effective, God help our healthcare workers",Sat Feb 29 21:31:42 +0000 2020,2,92,92,59:07.3,support
