2943721651851268922,Fri Jan 24 2020,@adam_ratcliffe The most affected country is China which is Asian and those over 60 have been affected more than any other group so far so Id say it was pretty representative. A picture of a white baby in a mask or a black teenage girl would make no sense for a virus whose epicentre is China,Fri Jan 24 20:57:27 +0000 2020,0,0,0,41:58.3,support

2943721651851268922,Fri Jan 24 2020,Can someone please tell me how every news outlet using any old picture of Asian people in face masks to scaremonger about this coronavirus  isnt horrifically racist!?,Fri Jan 24 20:55:45 +0000 2020,0,1,1,41:58.3,deny
2943721651851268922,Fri Jan 24 2020,@adam_ratcliffe I realised that after Id tweeted. I dont think its intended to be racist at all but it is an irrelevant image. Three U.K. students have bot all to do with the outbreak.,Sat Jan 25 19:59:15 +0000 2020,0,0,0,42:03.8,support
