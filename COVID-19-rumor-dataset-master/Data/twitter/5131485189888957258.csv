Meaning that the kind of mutations in the COVID 19 genome could be as a result of natural mutation or  targeted genetic engineering to come up with a new clone thats highly virulent - COVID-19",Mon Feb 17 14:22:38 +0000 2020,0,0,0,45:52.5,support

5131485189888957258,Mon Feb 17 2020,"@NathanGrubaugh @COVID2019_ @Power__Play Also highly improbable given the redundancy in both the effluent systems and security. Ive worked in numerous. If one considers all of the high containment labs around the world (3 and 4 labs), they have an exemplary record of safety.

5131485189888957258,Mon Feb 17 2020,@NathanGrubaugh @Power__Play @KindrachukJason I can assure you Im asking sincerely. Youre right; Im not a scientist. But Im open to be shown to be wrong. I used to wonder if COVID19 was artificially-created. But I rejected that idea several days ago when I was pointed to another paper that disproved it. This paper too. https://t.co/c9NQF0kAVz,Mon Feb 17 13:32:48 +0000 2020,0,2,2,45:52.5,support

5131485189888957258,Mon Feb 17 2020,@NathanGrubaugh @Power__Play @KindrachukJason But neither paper argued against the possibility of an accidental release of a naturally-evolved virus.The video shows: the scientists in Wuhan collected ticks from bats.

5131485189888957258,Mon Feb 17 2020,"@KenyanBern @NathanGrubaugh @KindrachukJason @Power__Play Thats my feeling. Keep in mind Im (trying) to make a measured claim: COVID19 is naturally-evolved, &amp; very likely (80%) made a natural jump to humans in Wuhan market, but there is also a chance (20%) it accidentally escaped a lab in Wuhan where they studied bats.Thats it ^",Mon Feb 17 14:18:55 +0000 2020,0,0,0,45:52.6,comment
