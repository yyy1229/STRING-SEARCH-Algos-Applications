7936363858513663851,Wed Jan 22 2020,@Just_Curius Snakes sold in the market for resale or perhaps for food prep or being butchered there for meat sale?Everything is on the table until it isn't.,Wed Jan 22 22:36:09 +0000 2020,0,0,0,01:04.7,comment
7936363858513663851,Wed Jan 22 2020,@MackayIM @TheOriginalBoto Is source this lab???? China built a lab to study SARS and Ebola in Wuhan - and US scientists warned in 2017 that a virus could 'escape' the facility located in the same city that's at the #coronavirus outbreak's center,Fri Jan 24 00:05:31 +0000 2020,2,1,1,01:04.7,comment
7936363858513663851,Wed Jan 22 2020,"@MackayIM A question: are there thousands of snakes slithering around Wuhan? Or has it jumped from snakes to, say, something like rats or mice, which are then infecting humans?",Wed Jan 22 22:29:53 +0000 2020,0,0,0,01:04.7,query

7936363858513663851,Wed Jan 22 2020,@MackayIM No one ive talked to or seen comment seems to think this is a robust method for identifying a reservoir.,Wed Jan 22 21:58:22 +0000 2020,0,7,7,01:04.7,comment
7936363858513663851,Wed Jan 22 2020,"@Emo_Giggles Yyp. And this isn't detection *in* a snake, it's basically modelling. So remain skeptical for now. The sequnce of the novel Wuhan virus is a closest match to bat CoVs. But hey, maybe there are a host of snake CoVs we've yet to find and sequnce and add to those conparisons ?",Wed Jan 22 22:32:50 +0000 2020,0,7,7,01:04.7,comment
7936363858513663851,Wed Jan 22 2020,"@MackayIM Okay, now I'm getting confused. Didn't the Chinese (I believe he was) scientist report that it was a bat with the closest resemblance?",Wed Jan 22 21:58:25 +0000 2020,0,1,1,01:04.7,comment
7936363858513663851,Wed Jan 22 2020,@Dasgirlnextdoor @TheOriginalBoto There's nothing to suggest that and everything hinting at a bat-related virus acquired from a wet market. Simple theories often closer to reality than very convoluted conspiracies IMO,Sun Jan 26 04:53:22 +0000 2020,0,5,5,01:04.7,comment
7936363858513663851,Wed Jan 22 2020,@chucky_dub @MackayIM Yes. I guess question is whether for example snakes (if thats true) are just another intermediate host ... that picked it up from bats along the line...#Wuhan #Quest4Reservoir,Thu Jan 23 02:11:55 +0000 2020,1,3,3,01:07.1,support

7936363858513663851,Wed Jan 22 2020,@MackayIM Aren't SARS and MERS believed to have originated in bats?  Would this mean the virus is likely quite different or snake / bat doesn't matter much as to the virus itself?,Wed Jan 22 22:07:56 +0000 2020,0,0,0,01:07.2,query
