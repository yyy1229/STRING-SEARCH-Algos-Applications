Im with Bernie 100%, but when you have undocumented family being threatened by Trumps gestapo and white supremacist groups, its hard to understand why anyone would not go out and vote. I hate Biden too, trust me",Tue Mar 03 02:21:20 +0000 2020,0,0,0,49:36.6,support

There are amazing justice democrats that support Bernies policies. We need more of them in Congress so that they fight for us. We could have more AOCs for example",Tue Mar 03 02:42:32 +0000 2020,0,0,0,49:36.6,support

But what about the undocumented, the disenfranchised? We have every right to be outraged by the DNC, but we cant pretend like another 4 yrs of Trump will be good for ppl",Tue Mar 03 02:37:53 +0000 2020,0,0,0,49:36.6,query
