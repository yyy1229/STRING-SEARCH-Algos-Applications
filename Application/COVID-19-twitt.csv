@BillGalvano Cancer spread by vaccination. https://t.co/gmwwSeQM85,
@BillGalvano Many vaccine ingredients are KNOWN to cause cancer!  @BillMontford @kellistargel @mannydiazjr @lizabethbenaquisto @edhooper @Jsmithjax @max4metals @Movanhook @rsbellmedia,
"@BGailQu It wasnt given cancer but rather disrupted cells to the point of toxic morphology. Then, the body if immune suppressed enuf, healthy cells will die off and lose the defense allowing the cancer cell that do not die off to invade.#antivax #protectthechildren #stopthemadness",
@BGailQu Deliberately.,
"@BGailQu Its more complicated than that, not all the vaccines were contaminated (plus quality standards are much better now), link to possible cancer still unclear. Also, the #vaccines now are very different from 50+ years ago -- the science keeps evolving. https://t.co/Vrfc89J0fV",
"@VisionEconomic1 I don't know either. The mortality rate is higher than a normal flu strain. And the rate of hospitalization is higher. And it's highly contagious. But the weird thing is the variation. In Rome a couple from China got it, they'd toured Italy and then ended up on ventilators...",
"@VisionEconomic1 Well it's certainly plunging this place into chaos. The first patient is a 38-year-old athlete with a pregnant wife. They got it and pneumonia and are in serious condition. It's strange, seems like it effects some people more than others, sometimes hits young, healthy people hard",
"@VisionEconomic1 And it's all blowing up, 7 dead, mostly elderly and/or sick except the last that was only 62.I dunno. Sure, the total deaths won't approach normal flu, but people are afraid of how severe the symptoms are and the death rate. It's a madhouse in the North now, not much better here",

Are any clinicians suspected of having COVID-19 and has there been sufficient time for their results to be back if any have been tested? ""None have tested positive yet"" is not reassuring.",

@EpochTimesChina Sounds like they're not treating ppl just quarantine? That's communism..,
